<h3>In a short essay, I'd like to describe my time here!</h3>
<p>As an international student, who made the flight to the US for higher studies, UMKC have had the warmth for me to settle in and start my academics with the start of spring semester. Couple of semesters have passed by, still every day here feels like a new beginning to me. That intriguing it was to me.</p>
<p>UMKC stands for <strong>UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI - KANSAS CITY</strong></p>
<p>University of Missouri has 4 branches</p>
